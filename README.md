# NetherMath

This Python program is a scientific calculator or I can say an advanced calculator that performs various mathematical operations. It includes functions for basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentiation, conversions, and more.

## Installation

Open the terminal or command prompt

Clone the repository using this command:

`https://github.com/saphiraaa/NetherMath`

Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located:

`cd NetherMath`

Install the necessary requirements:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run the script using the command:

`python3 nethermath.py`

Enter the number of your desired operator.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.
- Exponentiation and square root.
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent.
- Logarithmic functions.
- Conversion between different number systems: decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal.
- Conversion between different units of distance: meters, light-years, kilometers, feet, and miles.
- Calculation of Pi (Ï€) and Euler's number (e).
- Avogadro's number calculation.
- Evaluation of mixed mathematical expressions.
- Conversion between different scales of weight: kilograms, pounds, tons, grams, and stone.
- Saving and viewing previous calculations.
